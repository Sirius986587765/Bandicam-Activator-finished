###Bandicam uses internet connection for its own reasons and that sometimes might catch you not having licensed bandicam,
 as a result, it will pop up to register.
================================================================================================================================================
To solve that you will need to either block it(THE INTERNET CONNECTION ACCESS) from your windows defender manually or just run the bat exe to automatically run bandicam offline
