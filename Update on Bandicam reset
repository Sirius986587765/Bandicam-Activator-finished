After using it for some time I can tell you it's not a permanent solution, i personally used keygen a few times before i deleded it and just used bandicam reset.
The way this "activation" works it's actually really old,it doesn't really activate it just reverts the time back. I also learned that you even 
if you block every connection it will still reach its servers and you can actually use this to legit download updates on bandicam.
